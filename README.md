#Squirrel Tracker Project

This is an application to keep track of the known squirrels in Central Park. The application is populated with the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census data, but allows the user to add and update the app with their own sightings. Import and Export commands allow users to import squirrel data directly to the site, or export the data to a csv file.

#Available Views:

sightings/ : A table of all the squirrel sightings and links to view more details about each unique squirrel
sightings/<unique_squirrel_id> : Details about each squirrel sighting such as latitudude and longitude coordinates,date of the sighting, and age of the squirrel. A particular sighting can also be updated in this view.
map/: A map plotting the locations of 100 squirrel sightings
sightings/add: A form to add a new squirrel sighting to the database.
sightings/stats: A view to see general stats about the squirrel sightings.
